# Predicting-a-class-for-a-new-data-point-based-off-of-the-features-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
Using K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features
The data used for this project can be found in KNN_project_data; the python code is in the notebook. All code is written in Python 3.
